Description: OPM core library -- development files
 The OPM core library is the core library within OPM and contains
 * Eclipse deck input and preprosessing
 * Fluid properties (basic PVT models and rock properties)
 * Grid handling (cornerpoint grids, unstructured grid interface)
 * Linear Algebra (interface to different linear solvers)
 * Pressure solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
 * Simulators (some basic examples of simulators based on sequential splitting schemes)
 * Transport solvers (various discretization schemes, flow models)
 * Utilities (input and output processing, unit conversion)
 * Wells (basic well handling)
